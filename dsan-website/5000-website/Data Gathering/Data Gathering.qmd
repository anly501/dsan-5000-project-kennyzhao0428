# overview

This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the diverse factors that influence people's decision not to purchase an Electric Vehicle (EV), segmented by age and gender. In its first column, it classifies the survey participants into distinct categories based on their gender and age brackets, such as "Female", "45-59", and so forth, alongside the already mentioned "Male", "18-29", "30-44" groups. Following this, the dataset presents a series of columns that enumerate various reasons individuals may choose not to own an EV. These reasons are quantified in terms of percentages, reflecting the prevalence of each concern within the specified demographic group.

For instance, the dataset highlights that the cost of EVs is a significant barrier for many age groups. Other reasons could include lack of charging infrastructure, range anxiety, or a preference for traditional vehicles, each represented with its respective percentage to show how commonly it is cited as a reason among each group. It's noteworthy that some cells in the table are marked with 'N/A', which indicates that the data for that particular category is either unavailable or not relevant to the study.

Moreover, the dataset includes detailed footnotes at the bottom. These footnotes provide essential clarifications and additional information about certain categories. For example, a footnote might elaborate on what is encompassed under a reason like "Includes lack of power/acceleration in EV", offering deeper insights into specific concerns of potential EV buyers.

Overall, this dataset offers a thorough and nuanced understanding of the various barriers different demographic groups face in considering the acquisition of an Electric Vehicle. It's an invaluable tool for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders aiming to address these barriers and increase the adoption of EVs across different segments of the population.
