    "section": "Research Background",
    "text": "Research Background\nIn today’s fast-paced modern society, individuals are frequently confronted with significant life stresses. These pressures can arise from work responsibilities, academic demands, social interactions, family obligations, and various challenges of daily life. Simultaneously, the widespread use of electronic devices, information overload, and the prevalence of social media add an additional layer of stress to individuals’ lives. This high-stress lifestyle can often lead to anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, and health issues.\nIn this context, relaxation has become a critical factor in maintaining both physical and mental well-being. Relaxation not only aids in relieving bodily tension and fatigue but also enhances emotional tranquility, improves sleep quality, boosts resilience to stress, and promotes healthier lifestyles. However, effective relaxation is more than just reducing fatigue; it also involves learning to manage and cope with the everyday pressures in order to better deal with challenges and important tasks.\nAs such, researching how to efficiently relax has emerged as an essential endeavor. Understanding various relaxation methods, investigating their physiological and psychological effects, exploring individual differences, and identifying suitable relaxation strategies for diverse individuals are all indispensable components of helping people navigate the stresses of modern life more effectively. This study aims to delve into various aspects of relaxation, offering valuable insights and recommendations to enhance quality of life, promote health, and foster happiness."

    "section": "Research Purpose",
    "text": "Research Purpose\nRelaxation is defined as both physical and mental, and most relaxation activities are done from these two aspects. I think there are many relaxation methods, such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, spa baths, massage, art therapy, etc. Let’s understand how these relaxation methods work and try to analyze their true efficacy. Of course, I think these studies have individual differences to a large extent. For example, some people like sports and feel very comfortable after sports, while some people like to stay at home and watch movies, which means that some people prefer mental relaxation while others prefer physical relaxation. And some people are stressed and some people are not stressed. So consider that some methods work better for some people and may not work for others. I want to study the issue of relaxation from many aspects, and how to better communicate the importance of relaxation and its impact on the body to the public. I think there are also many possibilities for research methods, such as what data to collect to reflect the aspects that you want to study."
